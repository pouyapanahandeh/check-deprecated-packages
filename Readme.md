This npm package provides a utility for checking for deprecated packages in a given npm project. The package is written in JavaScript and can be installed using the npm install command. Once installed, the package provides a command-line interface that can be used to check for deprecated packages in the project.

For the purpose of obtaining a list of all outdated packages in the project, the code uses the npm outdated command. In order to determine whether a package is deprecated and whether any updates are available, it parses the output of this command.

The package also provides detailed information about each deprecated package, including its name, version, and deprecation message. This information can be helpful for developers who need to update their code to use a non-deprecated package.

Each function in the code performs a specific function. As a result, the code can be easily modified and extended as needed. To help developers understand how the code works, it is thoroughly documented and includes comments.

This npm package is useful for developers who need to keep their projects up-to-date and free of deprecated packages.
